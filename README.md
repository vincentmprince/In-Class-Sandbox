# In-Class-Sandbox

Here I am learning about using git as my version control system

The 'README.md' file is a markdown file where I can share important notes about my code repository.

I can create **bold** text (wrapped by two asterisks) or *italic* text (wrapped by one asterisk).

I can create fenced code blocks using back ticks, like this:

```csharp
public static void Main(string[] args)
{
  Console.Writeline("Hello World");
}
```

I am learning about

- Creating a git repository (online, and on my computer)
- Synchronizing my git repository on [GitHub](https://github.com)
